# Replication files for "Favoritism Towards High-status Clubs: Evidence from German Soccer" (JLEO, 2022)
This repository contains the replication data and code for the paper "Favoritism Towards High-status Clubs: Evidence from German Soccer" (Bose, Feess and Mueller in Journal of Law, Economics and Organization, 2022).
The paper is largely based on proprietary data aquired in 2014 from the company then called Deltatre (formerly Impire - in 2021 Sportec Solution). Because of the proprietary nature of the data we are unable to share this dataset. Furthermore, given the time that has passed and the restructuring of the company, we cannot guarentee that some of the datasets have been restructured by Sportec Solutions. This means that our code might not run smoothly even after the same dataset has been aquired from Sportec Solution.
In the repository, we nevertheless provide replication code for the paper as good as we can. We furthermore provide any data that is not proprietary and used in the paper.

## Requirements
All code was run on Mac OS 10.15.7 with Stata/MP 16.1. The following packages need to be installed. For Stata packages, the code will try to install them if there are not aleady installed, however this might not always work as intended. Therefore it is advised to install them by hand before starting the replication code.

|Package|How?|
|-------|----|
|`ftools`|`ssc install ftools`|
|`reghdfe`|`ssc install reghdfe`, then `reghdfe, compile`|
|`blindschemes`|`ssc install blindschemes`|
|`texdoc`|`ssc install texdoc`|
|`mrobust`|`ssc install mrobust`|
|`firthlogit`|`ssc install firthlogit`|


## Proprietary data
The data was acquired in 2014 and spans the years 2000 until mid 2013. It can be aquired from Sportec Solutions (https://www.sportec-solutions.de/) asking for data on "Qualit√§t der Schiedsrichterentscheidungen". The provided data should contain information on all recorded referee decisions regarding penalties (given or not given) and goals (awarded and not awarded) for the German "Bundesliga". In 2014, we received the data in Excel format, however the data provider might have changed this in the meantime. To ensure that the code we provide does run with the purchased data, please make sure that the data is saved as an excel file and fulfills the following criteria:

* Excel file should contain sheets "Tor", "Elfmeter", "Tor nicht gegeben", "Elfmeter nicht gegeben"
* The sheets should contain at a minimum the following columns, in case columns are named differently, please make sure to correct this before running the replication code

### For sheet "Tor":

## How to run the replication
To run the replication, adjust the file _master.do_. Here please update the global macros `path` and `data`. These should contain the filepath to the directory with the _master.do_ file and the filepath to the aquired data (from Sportec Solution, see detailed description above).
Once you have adjusted the path, simply run the do file _master.do_. It will call all other do files and you should end up with all tables in TeX format in the folder _tables_ and with all figures from the paper in the folder _figures_.
The creation of some talbes and figures takes a very long time (24+ hours), they are by default not executed. You can change this in the _master.do_ by setting the appropriate global macro to "True".

## Some final notes
Some figures and tables include tests that have been edited in by hand. In this case. The tests will be run by the replication files and saved in the folder _logs_ and a file named after the figure or table. E.g. _figure\_2\_tests.smcl_.
Some figures in the paper consist of multiple graphs, in this case, each graph is saved under the _figure\_x\_y.png_, where _x_ is the figure number and _y_ increases for each graph (e.g. _figure\_4\_1.png_ and _figure\_4\_2.png_).
